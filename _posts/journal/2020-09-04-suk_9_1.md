### Title : [Some theoretical properties of GANS](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aos/1594972829)  

#### Abstract
> In this paper, we offer a better theoretical understanding of GANs by analyzing some of their mathematical and statistical properties. 
> We study the deep connection between the adversarial principle underlying GANs and the Jensen–Shannon divergence, together with some optimality characteristics of the problem. 
> In addition, taking a statistical point of view, we study the large sample properties of the estimated distribution and prove in particular a central limit theorem.

### Title : [On the optimal reconstruction of partially observed functional data](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1594972835)  

#### Abstract
> We propose a new reconstruction operator that aims to recover the missing parts of a function given the observed parts.
> This new operator belongs to a new, very large class of functional operators which includes the classical regression operators as a special case.

### Title : [On post dimension reduction statistical inference](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1594972830)  

#### Abstract
> The methodologies of sufficient dimension reduction have undergone extensive developments in the past three decades. 
> However, there has been a lack of systematic and rigorous development of post dimension reduction inference, which has seriously hindered its applications.
> 
> Within this general framework, we derive the influence functions and present the explicit post reduction formulas for the combinations of numerous dimension reduction and model building methods.

### Title : [Nonparametric regression using deep neural networks with ReLU activation function](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1597370649)  

#### Abstract
> We consider large networks with number of potential network parameters exceeding the sample size. 
> The analysis gives some insights into why multilayer feedforward neural networks perform well in practice.

### Title : [Optimal estimation of Gaussian mixtures via denoised method of moments](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1597370661)  

#### Abstract
> This paper considers estimating a k-component Gaussian location mixture with a common (possibly unknown) variance parameter.
> To overcome the aforementioned theoretic and algorithmic hurdles, a crucial step is to denoise the moment estimates by projecting to the truncated moment space (via semidefinite programming) before solving the method of moments equations.

### Title : [Partial identifiability of restricted latent class models](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1597370665)

#### Abstract
> Though widely used in various fields, such restricted latent class models suffer from nonidentifiability due to their discreteness nature and complex structure of restrictions. 
> This work addresses the fundamental identifiability issue of restricted latent class models by developing a general framework for strict and partial identifiability of the model parameters.

### Title : [Convergence rates of variational posterior distributions](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1597370669)

#### Abstract
> We study convergence rates of variational posterior distributions for nonparametric and high-dimensional inference. 
> We demonstrate the applicability of our general results for various models, prior distributions and variational classes by deriving convergence rates of the corresponding variational posteriors.

### Title : [A Logistic Factorization Model for Recommender Systems With Multinomial Responses](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2019.1665535)

#### Abstract
> In this article, we propose a two-way multinomial logistic model for recommender systems for categorical ratings.
> Specifically, we treat the possible ratings as mutually exclusive events, whose probability is determined by the latent factor of the users and the items through a two-way multinomial logistic function.

### Title : [A Fast Algorithm for Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Mixture Proportions Using Sequential Quadratic Programming](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2019.1689985?src=recsys)

#### Abstract
> Maximum likelihood of mixture proportions has traditionally been solved using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, but recent work by Koenker and Mizera shows that modern convex optimization techniques—in particular, interior point methods are substantially faster and more accurate than EM. 
> Here, we develop a new solution based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP).

### Title : [Bayesian Deep Net GLM and GLMM](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2019.1637747)

#### Abstract
> We describe flexible versions of generalized linear and generalized linear mixed models incorporating basis functions formed by a DFNN.

### Title : [A Pliable Lasso](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2019.1648271)

#### Abstract
> We propose a generalization of the lasso that allows the model coefficients to vary as a function of a general set of some prespecified modifying variables. 
> These modifiers might be variables such as gender, age, or time.

### Title : [Characterization of topic-based online communities by combining network data and user generated content](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-020-09947-5)  

#### Abstract
> This study proposes a model for characterizing online communities by combining two types of data: network data and user-generated-content (UGC). 
> The existing models for detecting the community structure of a network employ only network information.
>
> However, not all people connected in a network share the same interests. 
> For instance, even if students belong to the same community of “school,” they may have various hobbies such as music, books, or sports.
> Hence, it is more realistic and beneficial for companies to identify communities according to their interests uncovered by their communications on social media.

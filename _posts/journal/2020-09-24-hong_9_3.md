### Title : [Graph-ResNets for short-term traffic forecasts in almost unknown cities](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v123/martin20a.html)

#### Abstract
> The 2019 IARAI traffic4cast competition is a traffic forecasting problem based on traffic data from three cities that are encoded as images. We developed a ResNet-inspired graph convolutional neural network (GCN) approach that uses street network-based subgraphs of the image lattice graphs as a prior. We train the Graph-ResNet together with GCN and convolutional neural network (CNN) benchmark models on Moscow traffic data and use them to first predict the traffic in Moscow and then to predict the traffic in Berlin and Istanbul. The results suggest that the graph-based models have superior generalization properties than CNN-based models for this application. We argue that in contrast to purely image-based approaches, formulating the prediction problem on a graph allows the neural network to learn properties given by the underlying street network. This facilitates the transfer of a learned network to predict the traffic status at unknown locations.

### Title : [Recurrent Autoencoder with Skip Connections and Exogenous Variables for Traffic Forecasting](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v123/herruzo20a.html)

#### Abstract
> The increasing complexity of mobility plus the growing population in cities, together with the importance of privacy when sharing data from vehicles or any device, makes traffic forecasting that uses data from infrastructure and citizens an open and challenging task. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to deal with predictions of volume, speed and main traffic direction, in a new aggregated way of traffic data presented as videos. Our approach leverages the continuity in a sequence of frames, learning to embed them into a low dimensional space with an encoder and making predictions there using recurrent layers, ensuring good performance through an embedded loss, and then, recovering back spatial dimensions with a decoder using a second loss at a pixel level. Exogenous variables like weather, time and calendar are also added in the model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling approach for sequences that ensures diversity when creating batches, running in parallel to the optimization process.

### Title : [Mini-Batch Metropolis–Hastings With Reversible SGLD Proposal](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2020.1782222)

#### Abstract 
> Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are computationally intensive and do not scale well to large data. In particular, the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm requires passing over the entire dataset to evaluate the likelihood ratio in each iteration. We propose a general framework for performing MH-MCMC using mini-batches of the whole dataset and show that this gives rise to approximately a tempered stationary distribution. We prove that the algorithm preserves the modes of the original target distribution and derive an error bound on the approximation with mild assumptions on the likelihood. To further extend the utility of the algorithm to high-dimensional settings, we construct a proposal with forward and reverse moves using stochastic gradient and show that the construction leads to reasonable acceptance probabilities. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in both low dimensional models and high dimensional neural network applications. Particularly in the latter case, compared to popular optimization methods, our method is more robust to the choice of learning rate and improves testing accuracy. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

> JSM에서도 비슷하게, scalable MCMC에 관한 강연이 있었다. Introduction에 따르면, scalable MCMC는 data를 mini-batch로 나누고 각 mini-batch별로 MCMC를 진행하여서 이를 합치는 방법이 있고 (JSM 강연 방식), 이 논문은 각 iteration마다 data에서 mini-batch를 sampling하는 방법을 사용한다. 다양한 data에서 robust한 결과를 얻음을 보여주고 있으며, dataset의 size뿐만 아니라, parameter set의 size에 대해서도 scalable하다는 것을 보여주고 있다.

### Title : [Simultaneous Detection of Signal Regions Using Quadratic Scan Statistics With Applications to Whole Genome Association Studies](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2020.1822849)

#### Abstract 
> We consider in this paper detection of signal regions associated with disease outcomes in whole genome association studies. Gene- or region-based methods have become increasingly popular in whole genome association analysis as a complementary approach to traditional individual variant analysis. However, these methods test for the association between an outcome and the genetic variants in a pre-specified region, e.g., a gene. In view of massive intergenic regions in whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies, we propose a computationally efficient quadratic scan (Q-SCAN) statistic based method to detect the existence and the locations of signal regions by scanning the genome continuously. The proposed method accounts for the correlation (linkage disequilibrium) among genetic variants, and allows for signal regions to have both causal and neutral variants, and the effects of signal variants to be in different directions. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed Q-SCAN statistics. We derive an empirical threshold that controls for the family-wise error rate, and show that under regularity conditions the proposed method consistently selects the true signal regions. We perform simulation studies to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed method. Our simulation results show that the proposed procedure outperforms the existing methods, especially when signal regions have causal variants whose effects are in different directions, or are contaminated with neutral variants. We illustrate Q-SCAN by analyzing the WGS data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.

### Title : [Using the “Hidden” Genome to Improve Classification of Cancer Types](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.13367)

#### Abstract 
> : It is increasingly common clinically for cancer specimens to be examined using techniques that identify somatic mutations. In principle these mutational profiles can be used to diagnose the tissue of origin, a critical task for the 3-5% of tumors that have an unknown primary site. Diagnosis of primary site is also critical for screening tests that employ circulating DNA. However, most mutations observed in any new tumor are very rarely occurring mutations, and indeed the preponderance of these may never have been observed in any previous recorded tumor. To create a viable diagnostic tool we need to harness the information content in this “hidden genome” of variants for which no direct information is available. To accomplish this we propose a multi-level meta-feature regression to extract the critical information from rare variants in the training data in a way that permits us to also extract diagnostic information from any previously unobserved variants in the new tumor sample. A scalable implementation of the model is obtained by combining a high-dimensional feature screening approach with a group-lasso penalized maximum likelihood approach based on an equivalent mixed-effect representation of the multilevel model. We apply the method to the Cancer Genome Atlas whole-exome sequencing data set including 3702 tumor samples across 7 common cancer sites. Results show that our multi-level approach can harness substantial diagnostic information from the hidden genome.
